                I am currently a <i>JSPS Fellow</i> at  <a href="https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/">Kyushu University</a> in Fukuoka.
                <br>
                Previously, I was a <i>Leibniz Fellow</i> at the

                My research is in the field of algebraic and geometric combinatorics with connections to commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. 
                
                I am particularly interested in the interplay between combinatorial, algebraic and
                geometric properties of hyperplane arrangements, that is, finite sets of codimension one subspaces
                in a finite dimensional vector space. 
                
                The study of these easily defined structures leads to
                beautiful and deep connections between algebra, combinatorics, geometry and
                topology.

                In particular, my research focuses on:

                    <p class="justify">
                      A hyperplane arrangement is called free, if a certain associated graded module
                      over the coordinate ring of the ambient vector space (the module of logarithmic vector fields or derivation module) 
                      is free.
                      <br>
                      The fundamental open problem is Terao's conjecture from the 1980s
                      asserting that freeness (over a fixed field) only depends on the
                      combinatorics of the arrangement, i.e. its intersection lattice.

                        A finite poset gives rise to a finite topological space whose topology
                        consists of the open sets which are increasing subsets, the so called Alexandroff topology.
                        The poset can also be regarded as a small category. 
                        Each functor from the poset to the category of abelian groups or modules over a commutative ring 
                        induces a sheaf of abelian groups respectively modules on the Alexandroff space.
                        <br>
                        For a hyperplane arrangement there are natural functors on its intersection lattice
                        giving rise to certain sheaves. Their cohomology is connected to important invariants 
                        and properties of the arrangement, in particular the freeness of the arrangement.

                    <p class="justify">
                        Finite complex reflection groups are groups generated by linear transformations of finite order
                        with fixed-point space a hyperplane.
                        Naturally associated to each reflection group is its reflection arrangement consisting
                        of all the reflection hyperplanes.
                        <br>
                        These highly symmetric arrangements have always played a prominent role in the study of 
                        hyperplane arrangements.
                        They provide interesting examples for many phenomena and in considering  
                        this class the deep connections of algebra, combinatorics, geometry and topology
                        in the study of hyperplane arrangements become most clearly apparent.

                    <p class="justify">
                        A simplicial arrangement is a hyperplane arrangement in a real vector space which divides
                        the ambient space into simplicial cones.
                        
                        The class of simplicial arrangements encompasses the class of
                        all real reflection arrangements and their restrictions 
                        but contains many more sporadic configurations.
                        
                        Despite some partial results, a complete classification 
                        especially in higher dimensions is still wide open.
