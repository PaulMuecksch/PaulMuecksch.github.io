                            A simplicial arrangement is a hyperplane arrangement in a real vector space which divides
                            the ambient space into simplicial cones.

                                In the study of complements of complex hyperplane arrangements 
                                it is of particular interest when they are Eilenberg-MacLane K(pi,1)-spaces.
                                <br>
                                A central result is Pierre Deligne's theorem stating that the complement of a complexified
                                simplicial arrangement is a K(pi,1)-space. 
                                In particular, all reflection arrangements of a finite Coxeter group have this property.
                                In general, it is very hard to identify arrangements with aspherical complements.
                                <br>
                                For a complexified real arrangement Mario Salvetti introduced a regular CW-complex modeling
                                the homotopy type of the complement from the combinatorial structure of the
                                associated oriented matroid.

                                The study of the combinatorics of oriented matroids
                                and of maps between associated posets provides an interesting new approach
                                to the K(pi,1)-problem for complexes derived from oriented mattroids 
                                and therefor complements of complexified real hyperplane arrangements.
